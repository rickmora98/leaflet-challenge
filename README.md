This repository contains my solutions to Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework Assignment for week #15.<br>

The program querrys the USGS earthquake API for the last seven day's earthquake data and displays it on a map in the user's browser.
Larger magnitude earthquakes are marked by larger circles than the ones with smaller magnitudes.  Deeper quakes are represented with
lighter colors than those occurring near the surface (deeper quakes are less damaging).  The map also displays the tectonic plate
boundaries.  Three map views are available:  Street, Topographic, and Satellite Image.<br>

To run the program, click on the deployed website link below.<br>
To examine the code files, their locations are indicated in the tree below.
